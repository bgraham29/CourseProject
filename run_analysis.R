# This program merges and analyzes training and test sets from the files 
    available at
#  https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
#  downloaded 10/25/2014
#
#  Download and unzipping code is not included. Code can be run as long as 
#    the Samsung data is in your working directory in a sub-folder titled
#    "data" and with the same names as the unzipped files
#


## Step 1: merge the training and test sets to create one data set


## Step 2: extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation
    for each measurement


## Step 3: use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set


## Step 4: Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names


## Step 5: Create a second, independent tide data set with the average of each
    variable for each activity and each subject

## Submit: tidy data set; link to Github repository; code book describing
  the variables, data, any transformations or work performed to clean
  in CodeBook.md. Also include a README.md in the repo explains how all the
    scripts work and how they are connected.
